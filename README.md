## Description

An application that uses data from a fictional soccer league to analyze team performance for specific seasons and across seasons.

## Status

This project is currently in development.

## Goals

  - Use Test Driven Development
  - Develop an Object Oriented solution
  - Write organized and readable code
  - Practice algorithmic thinking
  - Build classes with single responsibilities
  - Work in a group
  - Collaborate with partners via Pull Requests

## Design Description

As a team we reviewed the rubric and project requirements as a team. We followed the initial iteration pattern, given in the project. The statistics methods were split equally among the group members. We set GitHub pull request guidelines, code syntax, and working times during our initial Define the Relationship. We also utilized GitHub Projects to track open, in progress, and closed issues.

Additionally, we attempted to use Hound, an automated linter for code review, but found the suggestions intrusive, and we ended up abandoning the use a few days into the project.

We used Modules for our Games, Teams, and Game Teams statistics, and were wanting to implement additional features such as inheritance and the website, but ran out of time.

## Installation and Setup

You will need [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) installed globally on your machine.

```
# Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/hashmaster3k/futbol.git
cd futbol

# Run Application

# Run Test Suite
rake
```

## Technologies Used

Ruby
GitHub

## Reflection

__What was the context for this project?__

This is a group project created for Turing School of Software and Design

__What did you set out to build?__

A well tested and efficient soccer statistics analysis application.

__Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?__

The challenges we ran into were:

1. Initial planning and design of project
2. Working with CSV files for the first time
3. Mocks and Stubs

Because of these challenges we learned the different ways of setting up and structuring a project using classes and modules. We learned that using GitHub Projects can help structure the project flow, and organize outstanding issues. We also learned how to read external data sources such as CSV's. And lastly, we learned to implement, at least partially, some mocks and stubs into testing.

__What were some unexpected obstacles?__

Mocks and stubs presented some error messages, such as unexpected invocation, that we were unable to resolve within the project's timeline. This is something we are continuing to look into for solutions.

__What tools did you use to implement this project?__

Ruby, GitHub, GitHub Projects, Atom, Slack, Zoom, caffeine
